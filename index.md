## About Me
Hola amigo! I'm Nikhil Telkunte, persuing my M. Tech. from IIT Madras.I am currently working under [Prof V. Krishna Nandivada](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~krishna/) on Java Optimizations. 

## Projects
### Optimizing Java collection classes
- Optimized a few methods from Java collection classes by removing unnecessary condition checks and internal function
calls.
- Trying to build a module which takes a Java application code as input and identifies method calls which can be
optimized.
- Identified method calls will be replaced with their optimized version for better performance.

### Design of Mini-Java (a subset of Java) Compiler
- Compiler type-checked the input code and generated an intermediate “miniIR” code.
- Optimizations such as Conditional Constant Propagation, Loop Transformation and Function Inlining.
- The intermediate code also underwent points-to-analysis to determine the alias information.

## Work Experience
I have worked at [Kyazoonga.com](http://www.kyazoonga.com/) from Jun 2013 to Feb 2013. I worked mainly on maintainance and
developement of site. I had added some new features to the site such as seat layout for events. I had opportunity to see the real time client requirements during Pro Kabbadi Leauge and Caribbean Premier League. 

## Academics
I have completed my B. Tech. in Information Technology from [College of Engineering, Pune](http://www.coep.org.in/about/history) one of the oldest and most prestigious engineering institute in India.

## Hobbies
I'm very fond of trekking. In my spare time I like to play chess, read books. I'm learning Japanese.
