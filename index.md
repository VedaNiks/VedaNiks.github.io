## About Me
I'm Nikhil Telkunte, persuing my M. Tech. from IIT Madras.I am currently working under [Prof V. Krishna Nandivada](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~krishna/) on Java Optimizations. 

## Projects
### Optimizing Java collection classes
- Optimized a few methods from Java collection classes by removing unnecessary condition checks and internal function
calls.
- Trying to build a module which takes a Java application code as input and identifies method calls which can be
optimized.
- Identified method calls will be replaced with their optimized version for better performance.
### Design of Mini-Java (a subset of Java) Compiler
- Compiler type-checked the input code and generated an intermediate “miniIR” code.
- Optimizations such as Conditional Constant Propagation, Loop Transformation and Function Inlining.
- The intermediate code also underwent points-to-analysis to determine the alias information.
